        "question": "Background:\n<start of reference>\nSwamped by feelings of absolute helplessness, of being totally alone, for the first time in years the need for his mother became an almost physical thing. Unable to hold back the tide of overpowering emotions, the tears started and a small sob escaped from between his trembling lips.\n\nSuddenly the sound of a throat being cleared rang out in the otherwise silent room. Alex's already hunched shoulders rose even further. Hugging himself he began to rock back and forth, sobbing now in total misery.\n\n\"It's alright son,\" a deep male voice spoke out. \"Don't be afraid.\"\n\nThe voice sounded human, but could Alex really trust his ears. Who's to really know what an alien might sound like? Slowly lifting his head, not really wanting to look, but knowing he would have to eventually, he opened his eyes.\n\nIt was a man, just an ordinary man. The feeling of relief at the sight of him was nearly overwhelming.\n\nHe sat opposite Alex on what looked like a slim shelf; Alex himself was also sat on a similar structure on his side of the room. Upon closer inspection, these turned out to be beds, not shelves.\n\nThe man appeared to be older than him. In Alex's eyes anyone over the age of eighteen was just plain old, so it was hard for him to be accurate about the man's age. But if he had to, he would probably have guessed him to be in his mid-twenties. He was dressed in a light grey t-shirt and mid-thigh shorts, their tight figure hugging style looked to Alex a little like the gear cyclists wear.\n\nHis physique was that of an athlete, extremely well-muscled. Criss-crossing his entire body were multiple scars ranging from small faint ones to large deep red angry looking slashes. They were also quite prevalent on his face, but even with these frightening marks, he had a friendly look about him.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked smiling reassuringly.\n\nWiping his eyes with the back of his arm and sniffing loudly, Alex tried to answer, only managing a stifled croak. The stranger sat patiently, continuing to watch him, the look of encouragement on his scarred face made Alex feel calmer, swallowing hard he tried to speak again.\n\n\"A... Alex...\" he finally managed.\n\n\"Hello Alex, I'm Paul\" he said smiling \"I bet you're a little confused right now.\"\n\nAlex nodded \"What's... happening to me?\"\n\n\"I know how you feel son, well where do I begin?\" he scratched at his cheek, as his eyes wandered around the room, obviously trying to gather his thoughts before continuing. The lull in the conversation gave Alex a chance to get his first proper look at his surroundings.\n\nAlthough this room was just as white and stark as the one he'd awakened in, Alex had the feeling that this was a different one to the last room he'd been in. The four bare pristine walls, apart from the shelf beds, were totally devoid of any features whatsoever. The stark whiteness of them was matched equally by the floor and ceiling, making the whole room appear to merge together into one bright, blank sameness.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Alex asked tentatively as the silence dragged on, not really sure he wanted to know the answer to this or any other question, just needing the comfort of human interaction.\n\n\"I'm assuming you've met our hosts\" Paul answered looking back at Alex, who nodded.\n\n\"I know you must feel like you're going crazy, and what I'm about to tell you won't help... this isn't earth, we're somewhere... somewhere else, another planet.\"\n\nAlex felt faint as he tried to comprehend what Paul had just said, the whole room seemed to fade and close in on itself. Shutting his eyes, his stomach rolled, making him feel unsure whether he was going to be sick, as his overtaxed mind struggled to digest the information.\n\n\"You ok?\" Paul asked sounding concerned.\n\nAlex fought to stop the feeling of hysterical laughter that suddenly bubbled up at the total absurdity of the situation.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nFrom the text given, extract the boy's initial feelings and reactions when he discovers he's not on Earth.",

        "rationale": "extract the boy's initial feelings and reactions when he discovers he's not on Earth. First, we note that Alex is swamped by feelings of absolute helplessness and loneliness, indicating a deep emotional struggle. He experiences an intense need for his mother, which suggests a longing for comfort and security. As he begins to sob, it shows his emotional state is deteriorating, and he feels total misery. When he hears a voice and sees the man, there is a moment of relief, but this is quickly overshadowed by confusion and fear about his situation. When Paul informs him that he is not on Earth, Alex feels faint and struggles to comprehend the information, leading to a physical reaction of his stomach rolling and a sense of impending sickness. This combination of emotions\u2014helplessness, relief, confusion, and fear\u2014captures Alex's initial feelings and reactions upon discovering he is not on Earth.",

        "question": "What is the role of a prosecutor in a criminal trial? What are some of the key things they have to prove to convict someone?",
        "response": "A prosecutor is the attorney representing the government in a criminal trial. Their role is to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and to obtain a conviction. To do this, they must present evidence and convince the jury that the defendant is guilty of the crime.",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We start by identifying the role of a prosecutor, which is to represent the government in criminal proceedings. This includes presenting the case against the defendant and ensuring that justice is served. The prosecutor must gather and present evidence, call witnesses, and make legal arguments to support their case. The key things they have to prove include the elements of the crime charged, which typically involve demonstrating that the defendant committed the act (actus reus) and had the requisite mental state (mens rea) at the time of the offense. Additionally, they must establish that there is sufficient evidence to meet the standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is the highest standard of proof in the legal system.",

        "question": "Consider this reference information delimited in \"\"\":\n\"\"\"\nSo, we fellowship around the living area until dinner is called. We all sit in mismatched chairs around a large, high, round table in the middle of the open kitchen area. It is here that we first learn about and taste the Florida delicacy of rice topped with tomatoes. Though we aren't used to the classically southern soul food of collard greens and black eyed peas, the meal is in fact excellent, the fried fish perfectly seasoned and cooked (proof positive of the rave reviews we've been hearing all evening). It is a fun evening of laughter and fellowship with brothers and sisters in Christ that will prove to be a very rare occasion during deputation. We will always appreciate the time that this gracious family took to invite us over and share their home and cooking skills with us for that evening. It brightened our lives and our taste buds.\n\n### \\-----\n\nSunday mornings are always busy, and when we are going to a brand new church for a Sunday morning service, we truly never know what we will encounter. Florida has provided several interesting beginnings for our Sundays. One such meeting is scheduled to be at a church that is just outside a Native American reservation in south Florida. That morning, we've driven through miles and miles of endless sugar cane fields and groves of orange trees, able to count on one hand the number of buildings we've seen. We begin to wonder if the GPS is accurately directing us, and then we see it. Right on the edge of a field is a small clearing with palm trees dotting the lawn. The GPS leads us to the clearing, and we discover the church hidden among the fields of sugar cane. But, it isn't the church itself that surprises us when we pull in. It is such a quiet and serene morning; we never would've guessed what we are to find. Flashing emergency lights meet us in the parking lot. An ambulance with its back door open and no siren (thankfully) sits in front of the church's main door, taking up several parking spaces. We do not see anyone outside, so we park and simply sit in our vehicle for several minutes. We begin to pray for the situation even though we have no clue what is going on. Seconds tick by, I have no idea how many. Finally, two EMT's emerge, wheeling out a man on a stretcher. My husband and I look at each other as we wonder what to do. When the ambulance is gone, we get out of the car and wonder if anyone else is around the silent property. Within a few minutes, a woman, introducing herself as the pastor's wife, exits the church building and meets us. The pastor has been taken to the hospital with severe kidney stones and will not be present for church. Hmm, no pastor. Okay, no worries. My husband can lead Sunday school and the regular service as well. The pastor's wife informs us that only one older gentleman will be in attendance for the first service. This may be a little strange. It's always difficult to \"preach\" to a group of one. The services go as smoothly as possible, though the people are largely silent, even during the handshaking time. When the services come to a close, several people kindly thank us for being there and smile warmly, which certainly helps make things less uncomfortable. The pastor's wife takes us out for lunch at a local place featuring yummy local dishes (I try the Indian taco-which is really delicious) in a lush setting of green trees and sprawling fields of sugar cane. This meeting is memorable, not because of a new soul stirring sermon or an ornate building, but we will always remember this meeting because of the reminder from God that we are to be prepared to serve in any way that He needs at a second's notice. Sometimes He simply wants us to be present and prepared, able to do whatever may be needed. We are not sure why God didn't allow us to meet that pastor in person, but we pray that we were able to minister and be a blessing to those people in his absence.\n\n### \\-----\n\nSouth Carolina is a beautiful state.

        "response": "South Carolina is a beautiful state. Historical Charleston is a city that boasts of beautiful colonial architecture and stunning mansions, which were constructed by the rich and powerful of that era. The cobblestone streets are narrow and winding, taking you through the heart of the city and making you feel like you have stepped back in time. The smell of saltwater fills the air, making you feel as if you are walking on the beach. The lovely beaches are white and sandy, with crystal-clear water that is perfect for swimming and sunbathing. The gorgeous trees are everywhere, with their majestic branches reaching up to the sky. These trees are the perfect place to find shade and rest, away from the hot sun.

        "question": "Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nI was desperately looking for a good sub place in socal. I posted the question on yelp and this place was recommended. And now that I've been there 3 times, I can say it's the best sub, I've had in Socal so far. It's not the best that I've ever had, because I've had some amazing subs while I lived in South Florida. But I think you have to take location into account when rating a place. In South Florida Bree's gets 4 stars, here it gets 5. Now onto the Sandwich itself.\n\nOne \"problem\" with Bree's is that it's doesn't advertise itself as a sandwich place. It's a meat market. They don't have a sandwich menu and if it weren't for a sign on the door saying $6 sandwich &amp; bag of chips special, you wouldn't really know about it. Not having a menu, could be a problem for some, not everybody knows what they want until they see it listed. Basically they will create whatever you want. You pick the meat, you pick the cheese. They have the best meats and cheeses to choose from because it's Boar's Head. Although Bree's makes their own roast beef, which is fabulous. Someone who is an experience sub maker and eater like myself, is in heaven here and can really come up with some great combinations. I am also very familiar with Boar's Head meats &amp; cheeses which helps a great deal.\n\nI always test a place first with an Italian sub, so I asked for Deluxe Ham, Cotto, Genoa, Cappicoli, with provolone cheese. My 2nd sub is always some kind of All American -Club kind of thing. So I went Deluxe Ham, Ovengold Turkey, and Bree's Roast beef. Again with Provolone. And this last time I got a Roast beef with Horseradish Cheddar Cheese. Subs are available on white or wheat bread and only in one size. LARGE. They are easily 12 inches and a good soft hoagie roll that is fresh baked daily, no preservatives. Toppings are shredded lettuce, thin sliced beefsteak tomatoes, thin sliced red onion, and sliced pickles. Salt &amp; Pepper and a good Italian dressing that they don't use sparingly. And of course mayo &amp; mustard if you want. Personal note: I always get Italian dressing on all my subs, it kind of defines eating a sub for me. How the dressing mixes with the mayo - delish!\n\nNow I've only been to Bree's three times, but it seems their technique varies. The first time, I felt they were on to something with their prep. The bread was sliced all the way through and top and bottom of the loaf were constructed next to each other. Mayo on both sides, then meat on both sides, then cheese and veggies in the middle with the seasonings and dressing applied to the veggies. This was a good plan and I was impressed with the thinking. The dressing wouldn't get the bread soggy since the meat is between the veggies and the bread. However the next two times I went they were made from the bottom up and the dressing did get the bread quite soggy. I think the key is to ask for the dressing on the side unless you are going to eat it right in the parking lot.\n\nIt's a shame that they don't have a couple of tables outside. Subs always taste best when eaten on location. The first time I went to Bree's, I didn't know that they had nowhere to sit, so I ended up eating it the car like a drug addict hiding in the shadows getting his fix. But damn it was good and the quality you get for just $6 is impressive. It's all that and a bag of chips. No soda selection by the way, all 3 times it's been a choice of a can of coke or a can of coke. They do have a few potato and macaroni salads to choose from. They seem no different than what you get at Ralph's. They taste good, but nothing real unique about them.\n\nThe meat market has me intrigued. It looks real solid. They must have chicken kabobs made with like 8 different marinades. 5 or 6 different fresh made sausage. Nice looking steaks and ribs. I can't wait to try a few and grill them up at home. Thanks yelp and Chris D. for hipping me to this place. It's truly a hidden gem.\n###\n\nYou manage the meat market and are poring over reviews for your business. Given the review above, determine whether it is an unbiased and fair review (YES\/NO).",
        "response": "YES\n\nThe review is positive and seems unbiased. It highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of the business in a fair and balanced manner. The reviewer mentions both the high-quality Boar's Head meats and cheeses as well as the lack of a sandwich menu and the inconsistency in sub preparation technique. Overall, the review gives a genuine and accurate impression of the business.",
